Fleeting
========

This is a prototype of a tool to generate an ephemeral OpenShift installation
image.

Testing
-------

Put files to be populated by Ignition in the tree rooted at
`data/ignition/files/`. Put systemd units in `data/ignition/systemd/units`.
These are all built into the binary at compilation time.

The ZTP manifests provided by the users are read from `./manifests`.
The required manifests are:
* manifests/pull-secret.yaml
* manifests/cluster-deployment.yaml
* manifests/agent-cluster-install.yaml
* manifests/infraenv.yaml
* manifests/nmstateconfig.yaml

As a starting point for testing, you can substitute your SSH public key and
pull secret into the [example
manifests](https://gist.github.com/rwsu/ac65441b27fc0fe1961768db49a91262). Your
pull secret JSON data can be [obtained from the OpenShift
Console](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret).

Run the tool using `go run cmd/main.go`.

The output ISO is written to `output/fleeting.iso`.

Boot the ISO in a VM with at least 8192MiB of RAM. No storage is required.
The assisted-service UI is available on port 8080.

Node0
-------

To run the assisted service only on a pre-determined node a.k.a. node0, currently we have hardcoded a static IP 192.168.122.2. 
A systemd service named `node-zero.service` looks for the static IP and if the current node's IP matches with it then only the `assisted-service.service` systemd service is startred. The `assisted-service.service` is responsible for running the assisted service.

To set the static ip in libvirt:
1. Edit the default network
```
virsh net-edit default
```
2. Add `dns` and `host mac` for node0

```
<network>
  <name>default</name>
  <uuid>2467ce0f-aff2-4031-b0be-3e40fca96421</uuid>
  <forward mode='nat'/>
  <bridge name='virbr0' stp='on' delay='0'/>
  <mac address='52:54:00:bf:2b:d4'/>
  <dns>
    <host ip='192.168.122.2'>
      <hostname>node0</hostname>
    </host>
  </dns>
  <ip address='192.168.122.1' netmask='255.255.255.0'>
    <dhcp>
      <range start='192.168.122.2' end='192.168.122.254'/>
      <host mac='52:54:00:aa:aa:aa' ip='192.168.122.2'/>
    </dhcp>
  </ip>
</network>
```
3. Destroy and start network
```
sudo virsh net-destroy default
sudo virsh net-start default
```
